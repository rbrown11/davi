</p>

The davi pipeline is designed to automatically correct DeepLabCut (DLC) detections based on distance and the colour spots of paint-marked ants.

It consists of a series of 8 scripts, one for pre-processing and DLC analysis, one for each ant (1-6) and then a duplicate cleaning stage at the end.

To begin using davi, make sure to download all the python scripts in the scripts folder, and keep them in the same folder!
