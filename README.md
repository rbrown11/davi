The davi pipeline is designed to automatically correct DeepLabCut (DLC) detections based on distance and the colour spots of paint-marked ants.

It consists of one main script (davi_main_script.py), along with a Jupyter notebook script (assigning_cols), function scripts (hulls.py and davi.py) and a csv of colours to define the paint spot colours.
